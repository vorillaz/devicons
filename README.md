# Icons for Devs by zaprogramowany
### an iconic font made for developers, code jedis, ninjas, HTTPsters, evangelists and nerds.


Icons for Devs is a full stack iconic font ready to be shipped with your next project. Created by [Theodore Vorillas](http://twitter.com/vorillas) forked by Zaprogramowany.
Icons for Devs iconic font is free to use and licensed under [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).  


## Getting Started

 1. Download and extract the repository
 2. Copy the `iconsfordevs.css` to your project
 3. Copy the `fonts` folder to your project
 4. Ensure the font urls within `iconsfordevs.css` properly reference the `fonts` path within your project.
 5. Include a reference to the `iconsfordevs.css` file from every webpage you need to use it.


##Install using NPM
`npm install iconsfordevs`

##Create a custom set
In the repository you can find the IcoMoon manifest file [ `selection.json` ]. Load it into IcoMoon, make a proper selection of your desired icons and use them as you like. IcoMoon also can load `iconsfordevs.svg` file.

##Contribute to the project.
IcoMoon is your dear friend. Load your SVG file into IcoMoon, make any changes and ship produced the `selection.json` file. I don't recommend using the `selections.json` file from the master branch as I want to keep encoded HTML characters serialized. New icons will be added in ascending order. You may also contribute just by shipping a vector based icon. (EPS,AI,SVG).
