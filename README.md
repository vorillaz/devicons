# Forked version of [Devicons](http://vorillaz.github.io/devicons/)

As the original package did not get an update from 2017, i was hoping to host an updated version that includes all SVG files from pull requests in that repository, other icons from forked repository. I will also include missing devicons available from similar projects.

## This fork has the following additional Devicons

Do you like (â™¥) Devicons and want to support original author at his [gittip](https://www.gittip.com/vorillaz/) and visit his [website](http://vorillaz.com).

### Use Devicons with a single line of code

Thanks to the wonderful guys of [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) you can now add Devicons into your project by adding the following code into the `<HEAD>` section of your project's HTML:

`html <link href='//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/devicons@1.8.0/css/devicons.min.css' rel='stylesheet'>`

## Getting Started

1. Download and extract the repository
2. Copy the `devicons.css` to your project
3. Copy the `fonts` folder to your project
4. Ensure the font urls within `devicons.css` properly reference the `fonts` path within your project.
5. Include a reference to the `devicons.css` file from every webpage you need to use it.

## Install using Bower

`bash bower install devicons`

## Install using NPM

`bash npm install devicons`

## Create a custom set

In the repository you can find the IcoMoon manifest file [ `selection.json` ]. Load it into IcoMoon, make a proper selection of your desired icons and use them as you like. IcoMoon also can load `devicons.svg` file.

## Contribute to the project

IcoMoon is your dear friend. Load your SVG file into IcoMoon, make any changes and ship produced the `selection.json` file. I don't recommend using the `selections.json` file from the master branch as I want to keep encoded HTML characters serialized. New icons will be added in ascending order. You may also contribute just by shipping a vector based icon. (EPS,AI,SVG).
