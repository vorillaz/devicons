## Use Devicons with a single line of code.
Thanks to the wonderful guys of  [jsdelivr](http://www.jsdelivr.com/) you can now add Devicons into your project by adding the following code into the `<HEAD>` section of your project's HTML:

`<link href='//cdn.jsdelivr.net/devicons/1.8.0/css/devicons.min.css' rel='stylesheet'>`


## Getting Started

 1. Download and extract the repository
 2. Copy the `devicons.css` to your project
 3. Copy the `fonts` folder to your project
 4. Ensure the font urls within `devicons.css` properly reference the `fonts` path within your project.
 5. Include a reference to the `devicons.css` file from every webpage you need to use it.

## Install using Bower

`bower install devicons`

##Install using NPM
`npm install devicons`

##Create a custom set
In the repository you can find the IcoMoon manifest file [ `selection.json` ]. Load it into IcoMoon, make a proper selection of your desired icons and use them as you like. IcoMoon also can load `devicons.svg` file.

##Contribute to the project.
IcoMoon is your dear friend. Load your SVG file into IcoMoon, make any changes and ship produced the `selection.json` file. I don't recommend using the `selections.json` file from the master branch as I want to keep encoded HTML characters serialized. New icons will be added in ascending order. You may also contribute just by shipping a vector based icon. (EPS,AI,SVG).
